					[Intro: Eminem]</br></br>
					Uh</br>
					Yo, yo, yo, yo</br>
					</br>
					[Chorus: Eminem]</br></br>
					I've been to many places</br>
					I've seen so many faces</br>
					But nothin' compares</br>
					To these blue and yellow purple hills</br>
					I've climbed the highest mountain</br>
					Once or twice, but who's countin'?</br>
					But nothin' compares</br>
					To these blue and yellow purple hills</br>
					</br>
					[Verse 1: Eminem]</br></br>
					Cool, calm, just like my mom</br>
					With a couple of lawsuits inside her palm</br>
					It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve</br>
					To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves</br>
					I can't describe the vibe I get</br>
					When I drive by six people and {five I hit (Whoops!)}</br>
					{Aw shit,} I started a mosh pit</br>
					Squashed a chick and lost her foster kids</br>
					This room makes me hallucinate</br>
					Then I sweat 'til I start losin' weight</br>
					'Til I see dumb {shit} start happenin'</br>
					Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryna rap again</br>
					So bounce, bounce! Come on, bounce!</br>
					I said come on bounce!</br>
					Everybody in the house doin' mass {amounts (Me!)}</br>
					To the women in the thongs with their asses out (Oh)</br>
					We don't bull{shit}, better ask around</br>
					D12 throws the bombest bash in town</br>
					Bizarre, your mom is {crashin' out}</br>
					Help me get her on the couch 'fore she passes out (Come on)</br>
					</br>
					[Verse 2: Kuniva, Kon Artis (& Eminem)]</br></br>
					Bump that, someone help Denaun</br>
					He's upstairs wrestlin' with Elton John</br>
					Hey Von, you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?</br>
					They gotta be {Tums, the Ex-Lax} is gone</br>
					Yeah, I took 'em {all, dawg,} with some Parmesan</br>
					And I think my arm is gone — No, it's probably numb</br>
					Young, dumb and full of {cum}</br>
					And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue</br>
					Scary-ass, it was a false alarm</br>
					You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?</br>
					Well, stop actin' stupid; you so {high}</br>
					That you might wake up with a {guy} on some new {shit}</br>
					Yeah, I think I {did} too much (Huh-uh)</br>
					I think I got the runs (Huh-uh)</br>
					{Rolaids, Pepto, and Tums}</br>
					Watch out, here it comes! (Ha-ha-ha!)</br>
					</br>
					[Chorus: Eminem]</br></br>
					I've been to many places</br>
					I've seen so many faces</br>
					But nothin' compares</br>
					To these blue and yellow purple hills</br>
					I've climbed the highest mountain</br>
					Once or twice, but who's countin'?</br>
					But nothin' compares</br>
					To these blue and yellow purple hills</br>
					</br>
					[Bridge: Eminem]</br></br>
					Dirty Dozen, eighty of us</br>
					Shady brothers, ladies love us</br>
					That's why our baby mothers</br>
					Love us but they hate each other</br>
					They probably wanna take each other</br>
					Out and date each other</br>
					Some, some, some</br>
					Somethin'... I don't know</br>
					</br>
					[Verse 3: Proof & Bizarre]</br></br>
					Hop hills, hills I hop</br>
					Hop two hills, on stilts I walk</br>
					{Snort two lines} that were filled with chalk</br>
					Thought I was incredible and {killed} the Hulk</br>
					I wanna {roll} away like a rollerblade</br>
					Until my {eyes roll} back in my skull for days</br>
					And when I'm old and gray, yo, I'ma go for broke?</br>
					No? Okey-doke, {I'm packin' my nose} with soap</br>
					(*Coughing*) Am I supposed to choke?</br>
					Had an accident when the Trojan broke</br>
					Ah, poor baby, born by a {whore} lady</br>
					Now I'm payin' child support? (It's your baby!)</br>
					</br>
					[Verse 4: Swift, Bizarre (& Eminem)]</br></br>
					I take {four shots} at one time</br>
					And I don't need to chase when I'm swallowin' mine (Hey, you got any room?)</br>
					In Bizarre's hatch back</br>
					We can't go far, 'cause the car has flats</br>
					Why the hell you people think I rap?</br>
					Because my mother taught me how to breach contracts</br>
					And if you got cash, then hide it so (Swift, chill!)</br>
					I'm just tryna get by like you</br>
					And I don't give a damn if you find me rude (Huh-uh)</br>
					Mean, crude, to hell with you too (Huh-uh)</br>
					I only need three {blunts} and I'm cool</br>
					I just got some and I'm goin' back soon</br>
					</br>
					[Chorus: Eminem]</br></br>
					I've been to many places</br>
					I've seen so many faces</br>
					But nothin' compares</br>
					To these blue and yellow purple hills</br>
					I've climbed the highest mountain</br>
					Once or twice, but who's countin'?</br>
					But nothin' compares</br>
					To these blue and yellow purple hills</br>
					</br>
					[Verse 5: Bizarre]</br></br>
					I'm at a rave, lookin' at a babe</br>
					Like she want it</br>
					Gin and tonic demonic</br>
					Body smell like vomit</br>
					Looney, crazy, jumpy, sexy</br>
					Dopey-headed guy</br>
					Whipped cream, dirty mattresses</br>
					Wanna try? (Go on)</br>
					{Blue hills, golden seals}</br>
					Got Bizarre actin' ill</br>
					Drugs kill — {Yeah, right!}</br>
					Chick, I'm for real!</br>
					Shut yo' mouth, you dirty girl</br>
					You know you want me in your world</br>
					Ladies, please don't fight</br>
					Bizarre's here all night!</br>
					</br>
					[Chorus: Eminem]</br></br>
					I've been to many places</br>
					I've seen so many faces</br>
					But nothin' compares</br>
					To these blue and yellow purple hills</br>
					I've climbed the highest mountain</br>
					Once or twice, but who's countin'?</br>
					But nothin' compares</br>
					To these blue and yellow purple hills</br>
