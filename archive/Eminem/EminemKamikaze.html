						[Intro]</br></br>
						(Fack) Okay, (Fack) how do I say this? (Fack)</br>
						Last year (Fack) didn't work out so well for me (Fack)</br>
						(Fack last year!) (Fack) (Last year can eat a dick!)</br>
						2018, (Fack) well (Fack)</br>
						</br>
						[Verse 1]</br></br>
						Hah, yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze crashin' into everything</br>
						You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing</br>
						I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"</br>
						Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bed sheet and the comforter</br>
						Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass</br>
						I'll ride through your cul-de-sac</br>
						Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks</br>
						Y-You collaborative effort rap, I-I have never said his raps</br>
						O-Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap</br>
						And ruined your welcome mat</br>
						So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it (Wrote it) (Yeah)</br>
						While I teabag the microphone 'cause I go nuts on it (On it) (Yeah)</br>
						Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment</br>
						Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it</br>
						I'm 'bout to—</br>
						</br>
						[Chorus]</br></br>
						Smash into everyone, crash into everything</br>
						Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017</br>
						Fack, fack on everyone</br>
						Fack, fack on everyone</br>
						Fack, fack on everyone</br>
						I'm a Kamikaze, gonna</br>
						Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15</br>
						Damage already done, y'all shoulda let me be</br>
						Fack, fack on everyone</br>
						Fack, fack on everyone</br>
						Fack, fack on everyone</br>
						I'm a Kamikaze, gonna</br>
						</br>
						[Verse 2]</br></br>
						I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't (Wasn't)</br>
						From the moment I heard rappers cussin', I was in (Was in)</br>
						Which is why I identify with the guy</br>
						Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein</br>
						Energized like a nine volt</br>
						Ice cold like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll</br>
						But if the only reason I blowed is 'cause I'm white though</br>
						Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (Ooh)</br>
						Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note</br>
						Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me</br>
						'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes</br>
						'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone</br>
						I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here I go</br>
						Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to—</br>
						</br>
						[Chorus]</br></br>
						Smash into everyone, crash into everything</br>
						Back and I've just begun, "FACK" 2017</br>
						Fack, fack on everyone</br>
						Fack, fack on everyone</br>
						Fack, fack on everyone</br>
						I'm a Kamikaze, gonna</br>
						Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15</br>
						Damage already done, y'all should'a let me be</br>
						Fack, fack on everyone</br>
						Fack, fack on everyone</br>
						Fack, fack on everyone</br>
						I'm a Kamikaze, gonna</br>
						</br>
						[Bridge]</br></br>
						Smash</br>
						Kamikaze, kamikaze</br>
						Kami, kami-kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze (kamikaze)</br>
						Take a look at what I've done</br>
						</br>
						[Verse 3]</br></br>
						I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing</br>
						There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee that</br>
						Wait, that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air it</br>
						The shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare</br>
						In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher</br>
						Each nut is the chair width of an Acorn stairlift, beware of me</br>
						Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared</br>
						Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is</br>
						Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'</br>
						Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist</br>
						But somethin' here is a foot—oh yeah, it's my dick</br>
						Get the measurin' stick (What?), 12 inches of wood (Haha)</br>
						Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"</br>
						And I've come to pay respects</br>
						'Cause if you sleep you're fucked—other words</br>
						You get laid to rest and I hope your butt is hurt</br>
						Put me on a track, I go cray-on it like a color book</br>
						You got some views, but you're still below me</br>
						Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked</br>
						And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook</br>
						And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth</br>
						You're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth</br>
						And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do</br>
						When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you</br>
						And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do</br>
						Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot</br>
