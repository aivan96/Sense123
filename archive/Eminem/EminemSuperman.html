					[Intro: Eminem & Dina Rae]</br></br>
					Mhmmm *inhales*</br>
					You high, baby?</br>
					Yeah</br>
					Yeah?</br>
					Talk to me</br>
					You want me to tell you something?</br>
					Uh-huh</br>
					I know what you wanna hear</br>
					</br>
					[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]</br></br>
					I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too</br>
					(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too</br>
					I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world</br>
					I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl</br>
					You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too</br>
					They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you</br>
					I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world</br>
					(Oh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl</br>
					</br>
					[Verse 1: Eminem]</br></br>
					They call me Superman</br>
					Leap tall hoes in a single bound</br>
					I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now</br>
					I'd never let another chick bring me down</br>
					In a relationship; save it, bitch!</br>
					Babysit? You make me sick</br>
					Superman ain't savin' shit</br>
					Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick</br>
					Straight from the hip, cut to the chase</br>
					I tell a motherfuckin' slut to her face</br>
					Play no games, say no names</br>
					Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face</br>
					I'm a different man, kiss my ass</br>
					Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?</br>
					Kiss my dick, get my cash?</br>
					I'd rather have you whip my ass</br>
					Don't put out, I'll put you out</br>
					Won't get out, I'll push you out</br>
					Puss blew out, poppin' shit</br>
					Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out</br>
					Am I too nice? Buy you ice?</br>
					Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life</br>
					What, you tryin' to be my new wife?</br>
					What, you Mariah? Fly through twice</br>
					</br>
					[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]</br></br>
					But I do know one thing though</br>
					Bitches, they come, they go</br>
					Saturday through Sunday, Monday</br>
					Monday through Sunday, yo</br>
					Maybe I'll love you one day</br>
					Maybe we'll someday grow</br>
					'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho</br>
					</br>
					[Chorus: Eminem]</br></br>
					‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman</br>
					Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman</br>
					I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman</br>
					Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman</br>
					</br>
					[Verse 2: Eminem]</br></br>
					Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes</br>
					It's no secret, everybody knows</br>
					Yeah, we fucked: bitch, so what?</br>
					That's about as far as your buddy goes</br>
					We'll be friends, I'll call you again</br>
					I'll chase you around every bar you attend</br>
					Never know what kinda car I be in</br>
					We'll see how much you be partyin' then</br>
					You don't want that, neither do I</br>
					I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys</br>
					Too much pride, between you and I</br>
					Not a jealous man, but females lie</br>
					But I guess that's just what sluts do</br>
					How could it ever be just us two?</br>
					I'd never love you enough to trust you</br>
					We just met and I just fucked you</br>
					</br>
					[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]</br></br>
					But I do know one thing though</br>
					Bitches, they come, they go</br>
					Saturday through Sunday, Monday</br>
					Monday through Sunday, yo</br>
					Maybe I'll love you one day</br>
					Maybe we'll someday grow</br>
					'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho</br>
					</br>
					[Chorus: Eminem]</br></br>
					‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman</br>
					Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman</br>
					I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman</br>
					Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman</br>
					‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman</br>
					Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman</br>
					I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman</br>
					Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman</br>
					</br>
					[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]</br></br>
					I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too</br>
					(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too</br>
					I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world</br>
					I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl</br>
					You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too</br>
					They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you</br>
					I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world</br>
					(Oh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl</br>
					</br>
					[Verse 3: Eminem]</br></br>
					First thing you say: I'm not fazed</br>
					I hang around big stars all day</br>
					I don't see what the big deal is anyway</br>
					You're just plain old Marshall to me</br>
					Ooh yeah, girl, run that game</br>
					Hailie Jade, I love that name</br>
					Love that tattoo, what's that say?</br>
					"Rot In Pieces," uh, that's great</br>
					First off, you don't know Marshall</br>
					At all, so don't grow partial</br>
					That's ammo for my arsenal</br>
					I'll slap you off that bar stool</br>
					There goes another lawsuit</br>
					Leave handprints all across you</br>
					Good Lordy, whoadie</br>
					You must be gone off that water bottle</br>
					You want what you can't have</br>
					Ooh girl, that's too damn bad</br>
					Don't touch what you can't grab</br>
					End up with two backhands</br>
					Put anthrax on a Tampax</br>
					And slap you 'til you can't stand</br>
					Girl, you just blew your chance</br>
					Don't mean to ruin your plans</br>
					</br>
					[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]</br></br>
					But I do know one thing though</br>
					Bitches, they come, they go</br>
					Saturday through Sunday, Monday</br>
					Monday through Sunday, yo</br>
					Maybe I'll love you one day</br>
					Maybe we'll someday grow</br>
					'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho</br>
					</br>
					[Chorus: Eminem]</br></br>
					‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman</br>
					Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman</br>
					I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman</br>
					Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman</br>
					‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman</br>
					Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman</br>
					I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman</br>
					Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman</br>
					</br>
					[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]</br></br>
					I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too</br>
					(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too</br>
					I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world</br>

					Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman</br>
					‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman</br>
					Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman</br>
					I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman</br>
					Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman</br>
